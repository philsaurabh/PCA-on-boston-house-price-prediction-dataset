Principal Component Analysis Example Notebook 

## PCA(Principal Component Analysis)
It is not an algorithm of machine learning. It is just a technique of dimensionality reduction(From multiple number of independent features to less number of independent features) using new vector space.
The reason is that more dimensions may lead the dataset to suffer from underfitting.

## Dataset Key Description 
data: stores data<br/>
target:for output (0 for one class and 1 for other)<br/>
DESCR: Description of data<br/>
feature_names: name of columns in dataset<br/>

The difference between values in multiple columns is very very high. So, to normalize or scale it, standardscaler is used.
<br/>Then the data is plotted with the help of target values.
